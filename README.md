# AAA Remote Battery Board
 Remote RTC/CMOS/NVRAM battery for retro computer motherboards. Provides about +4.5V. Which is what most vintage motherboards require. +3V, like from a CR2032, is not appropriate!

 **Features:**
 * Higher voltage than CR2032 and higher capacity for longer life
 * Diode to prevent reverse charging
 * 100ma fuse to protect motherboard if a short develops
 * Nylon fuse holder contains fuse blast and glass
 * Uses 1x4 pin headers found on most motherboards for simple cabling
 * PCB cutouts for Cable tie to secure batteries in rough service situations
 * Mounting holes for M3 standoffs
 * No motherboard modifcations required!

## Here's a scan from a 386sx AT motherboard. Notice the voltages it requires. It warns against using +3V batteries like a CR2032!
